# Calculator Cricket

This is a game we used to play in maths when we were bored. I added a few other features, such as individual player scores, and a visual score card emulated from an old school teletext page.

To Do:
1. Add fall of wickets
2. Play again option
3. Indicate players who are not out
4. Improve .sample odds
5. Fix layout issues
6. Host a live version of the game
7. Clean up code

My goals while building this program include:
1. <del>Get familiar with git</del>
2. <del>Get familiar with the command line</del>
3. <del>Get some code up</del>
4. <del>Be more comfortable using OOP design practises</del>
